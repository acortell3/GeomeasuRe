Title: GeomeasuRe. An R package for capturing morphometric variability
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alfredo Cortell-Nicolau
Maintainer: Alfreco Cortell-Nicolau <alfredo.cortell-nicolau@uv.es>
Description: This package is able to offer the morphometry of polygonal objects, displayed as vectorised images, in different continuous measures. In order to do, it constructs a grid with 1 mm separated lines, and then measures the intersection between those lines and the polygon being measured. The result is a series of line-lengths which can be used in different ways depending on the research question.
